# Flash Card Application

This application uses a JSON file (`flash_cards.json`) to store and retrieve flash card data.

## How the JSON file works

The JSON file is an array of objects. Each object represents a flash card with a 'question' and 'answer' property.

Example:
```
[
    {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "Paris"},
    {"question": "What is 2 + 2?", "answer": "4"}
]
```

To add a new flash card:
1. Open `flash_cards.json` in any text editor.
2. Add a new object with 'question' and 'answer' properties to the array.
3. Save the file and restart the application.

Happy Learning!
